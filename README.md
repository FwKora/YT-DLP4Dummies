# YT-DLP4Dummies
my friends dont understanding putting 3 files in C:

Its Very simple

download this -> https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-essentials.7z
then download the yt-dlp exe either from the yt-dlp-exe-file branch or elsewhere on the web

go into cmd and put:

```cd ../../``` then ```mkdir yt-dlp```

copy the ffmprobe and ffmpeg exes from the 7z file to this folder it should be called C://yt-dlp
also copy the yt-dlp.exe to this file

open a new cmd and put ```cd ../../yt-dlp```

then put your command to download or whatever
